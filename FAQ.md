#Release Naming Convention

From the [GoT Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Noble_house):
In Westeros, there are nine Great Houses, and each of them have a number of vassal houses (sometimes also referred to as lesser houses) in their liege. The most powerful vassal houses may themselves field armies of a few thousand and control large regions, while the smallest houses may be little more than impoverished landholders with only a few men to their name. Members of the nobility are called "highborn", in contrast to lowborn commoners. 
Each of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms has about a dozen or so major Houses, i.e. House Umber is sworn to House Stark, rules a large area of the North, and several minor Houses serve the Umbers. House Cassel, meanwhile, is a minor House, sworn directly to House Stark, which has no minor Houses serving it. Thus there are roughly about 100 or so major Houses in the Seven Kingdoms at any one time, and numerous minor Houses who in turn serve them (not all of whom have been named). 

So, major releases will be named after major nouble houses in Westeros, while minor releases will be named after, you guessed it, minor houses :)

The next major release is 1.0.0 Targaryen. Potential 1.x.y minor releases:
Blackfyre, Cargyll, Hollard
